Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. This is the code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work  performed to clean up the data.

  1	  tBodyAcc-mean()-X
  2	  tBodyAcc-mean()-Y
  3	  tBodyAcc-mean()-Z
  4	  tBodyAcc-std()-X
  5	  tBodyAcc-std()-Y
  6	  tBodyAcc-std()-Z
  7	  tBodyAcc-mad()-X
  8	  tBodyAcc-mad()-Y
  9	  tBodyAcc-mad()-Z
  10	tBodyAcc-max()-X
Showing 1 to 10 of 561 entries, 2 total columns
